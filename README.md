## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores customer sentiments from Twitter data related to airlines. Using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, and **Machine Learning models**, the study uncovers how customers feel (positive, negative, or neutral) and identifies key drivers behind negative sentiments.  

The analysis provides insights to help airlines improve customer satisfaction and guide strategic business decisions.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Perform **EDA** to detect patterns, anomalies, and sentiment distribution.  
- Apply **NLP techniques** to preprocess and analyze text data.  
- Build and evaluate **sentiment classification models**.  
- Provide **business recommendations** for improving customer service.  

---

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset consists of **Twitter data** capturing airline passenger feedback. It includes:  
- Tweet ID & text  
- Sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)  
- Sentiment confidence score  
- Airline names  
- Reasons for negative tweets  
- User metadata (location, timezone, coordinates, timestamp)  

---

## 🧑‍💻 Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning tweets, tokenization, stopword removal.  
2. **EDA** – Visualizing sentiment distribution across airlines.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – TF-IDF vectors, word embeddings.  
4. **Modeling** – Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.  
5. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score.  
6. **Visualization** – Word clouds, sentiment comparison charts, airline-level breakdowns.  

---

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Majority of tweets expressed **negative sentiments**.  
- Certain airlines consistently showed **higher negative ratios**, highlighting service quality issues.  
- Neutral sentiments were common, offering opportunities to convert them into positive experiences.  
- Positive tweets highlighted punctual flights, staff friendliness, and good service.
